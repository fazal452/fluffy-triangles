# fluffy-triangles
Want the area of a triangle? do you have 3 points of reference? want to see a tacky GUI? LOOK NO FURTHER!

Alright, This was my first attempt at creating a gui, I used the module tkinter in Python to do so.

It is no the best looking nor the most efficient in regards of the time and memory used.

However, it is that this is a work in progress and will hopely get better
