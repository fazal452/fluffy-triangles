# fluffy-triangles
Want the area of a triangle? do you have 3 points of reference? want to see a tacky GUI? 

first attempt at creating a gui, I used the module tkinter in Python to do so.

It is no the best looking nor the most efficient in regards of the time and memory used.

However, is a work in progress and will hopefully get better
